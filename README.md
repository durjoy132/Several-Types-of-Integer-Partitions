Integer partitions are a fundamental concept in combinatorial mathematics, where an integer is expressed as a sum of positive integers. The various ways of partitioning an integer lead to different types of partitions, each with its own properties and significance. This chapter explores a broad range of integer partition types, providing definitions, descriptions, and examples to illustrate their diversity and applications.
